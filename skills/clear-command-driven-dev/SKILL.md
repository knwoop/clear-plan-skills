# Clear Command Driven Development

A workflow methodology: persist Plan Mode output externally, execute TODOs
one at a time with `/clear` between each, and continuously update the plan
as new information emerges. The 1M token context window is irrelevant —
small, focused context produces better results.

## Core Principles

1. **Plan first, code later** — Always start in Plan Mode to design before implementing
2. **Externalize memory** — Your note app is the persistent store; Claude's context is ephemeral
3. **One TODO, one session** — Each `/clear` resets context; each task gets full attention
4. **Living plans** — Plans are updated as implementation reveals new information

## The Cycle

```
Plan Mode ──→ Copy to clipboard ──→ Paste into your notes
                                          │
                ┌─────────────────────────┘
                ▼
         Pick a TODO item
                │
                ▼
         /clear ──→ Paste TODO + minimal context ──→ Implement
                │                                        │
                │              ┌─────────────────────────┘
                │              ▼
                │       Discovered something new?
                │         Yes ──→ /update-plan ──→ Update notes ──→ Commit ──→ /clear
                │          No ──→ Commit ──→ Mark TODO [x] ──→ /clear
                │              │
                └──────────────┘
```

| Skill | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `/create-plan` | Start a new plan for a feature or task |
| `/update-plan` | Revise an existing plan based on new findings |

## Execution Tips

- **Context loading**: When starting a TODO, provide only what Claude needs —
  the specific task, its target files, and relevant references. Do not paste the entire plan.
- **CLAUDE.md synergy**: Project-wide conventions belong in CLAUDE.md; task-level
  planning lives in your external notes. Do not duplicate.
- **Commit cadence**: Commit after each TODO completion, before `/clear`.
- **Update before clear**: If you discover something unexpected, run `/update-plan`
  while the context is still available, then `/clear` after committing.
- **Granularity**: Each TODO item should be completable in a single Claude Code
  session (roughly 10–30 minutes of implementation).

## Anti-Patterns

- Pasting the entire plan into every session (defeats the purpose of `/clear`)
- Skipping the plan update phase when encountering surprises
- Making TODO items too large (if it needs multiple files across modules, split it)
- Keeping stale plans — always reflect reality in your notes
